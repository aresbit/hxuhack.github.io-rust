I am currently a Pre-tunured Associate Professor at School of Computer Science, Fudan University. My research interests are within the fields of Cyber Security, Program Analysis, and AI System Reliability. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Michael Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu).

## News

- I am looking for self-motivated students.
